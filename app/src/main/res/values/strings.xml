    <string name="bio" >Darling, you are the most beautiful person I have ever met, you are like a reflection of the angels. I love you.
\n
\nI have to pinch myself several times to make sure I am not dreaming. You are so beautiful my love.
\n
\nYou don’t even have to look yourself in the mirror; you are a true reflection of the mirror. You are so beautiful my love.
\n
\n\nI can’t resist your love, you are my dreams, you are so beautiful, and I want to be with you forever.

\nYou hold the secrets of the beauty in this world, if there was a competition for the most beautiful woman in the world, you would win. You are so beautiful.
    How can one resist you, how can one say no to your love, how can one never want to love you. You are so beautiful my love.

\nYour beauty never stops glowing, no matter what time of the day or month; you still look beautiful, for your beauty is not outward but within your heart.
 \n   Your smile, your looks, your heart, words cannot explain, you are so beautiful my love.</string>
